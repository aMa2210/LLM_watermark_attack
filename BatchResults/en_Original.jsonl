However, weak bases do not fully dissociate in solution, meaning they do not donate OH- ions in significant amounts.\n\n2. **Option b**: \"Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.\"\n   - This statement is misleading. While strong bases dissociate completely to produce OH- ions, weak bases also produce OH- ions, albeit to a lesser extent. Therefore, this statement is not true for all bases.\n\n3. **Option c**: \"Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\"\n   - This statement is not accurate. While strong bases are good conductors due to complete dissociation, some weak bases can also conduct electricity, though not as effectively. Thus, this statement does not hold for all bases.\n\n4. **Option d**: \"For weak bases, the concentration of the OH- ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\"\n   - This statement is false. In weak bases, the concentration of OH- ions is typically less than the concentration of the undissociated base because weak bases do not dissociate completely.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, it is clear that none of the statements are universally true for all bases. However, option a is the closest to being true, as it applies to the definition of bases in general, even if weak bases do not fully donate OH- ions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 367, "completion_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 727, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_bd83329f63"}}, "error": null}

The Natural Law School is based on moral principles and universal truths, rather than customs being recognized by courts.\n3. The Historical School emphasizes the evolution of law through customs and traditions, but it does not specifically state that judicial recognition is necessary for a custom to become law.\n4. The Sociological School looks at law in the context of society and its customs, suggesting that customs can gain legal status through societal acceptance and judicial recognition.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Sociological School is the one that supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives the stamp of judicial recognition by courts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 523, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_bd83329f63"}}, "error": null}
