Input: A car travels 60 kilometers per hour for 2 hours and then 80 kilometers per hour for 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car for the entire trip?
a) 70 km/h
b) 72 km/h
c) 75 km/h
d) 74 km/h

Output:
First, I need to calculate the total distance traveled. For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 60 * 2 = 120 kilometers.
Next, for the second part of the trip, the car travels at 80 km/h for 3 hours, so the distance is 80 * 3 = 240 kilometers.
The total distance traveled is 120 + 240 = 360 kilometers.
Now, I need to calculate the total time spent. The total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.
To find the average speed, I divide the total distance by the total time: 360 kilometers Ã· 5 hours = 72 km/h.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}.
